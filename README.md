# Youtube clone

Introducing a unique YouTube Clone created by Mitr Joshi using React and TailwindCSS. This exceptional clone offers a range of cool features. One notable addition is the ability to save videos for later viewing, powered by Firebase. Users can easily remove videos from their watch later list as well. Additionally, Google authentication has been implemented to ensure a secure login process.

The YouTube Clone has been meticulously designed to be responsive, with a focus on desktop devices. While it provides a satisfactory experience on other devices, its optimal performance is tailored to desktop screens. To fetch videos, the application leverages the powerful Rapid API, ensuring a seamless streaming experience. Notably, a groundbreaking feature has been added to this clone - unlike the official YouTube app, users can now add shorts to their watch later list. This innovative addition sets the clone apart and adds an extra layer of functionality and enjoyment for users.
